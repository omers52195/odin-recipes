    <p>Chicken Shawarma Tacos</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala </li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chicken bouillon </li>
        <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon </li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs </li>
        <li>1 medium onion </li>
        <li>Ten 6-inch flour tortillas </li>
        <li>Tahini Sauce, recipe follows</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the curry powder, garam masala, chicken bouillon, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Rub all over the chicken and let marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
        <li>Spread the chicken out onto the lined baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 45 minutes. Let cool slightly, then slice into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice three-quarters of the onion and dice the remaining one-quarter. Set the diced onion aside for the topping. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil (or 2 tablespoons of the marinade) in a skillet over medium high and add the sliced onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and some of the marinade to the onions and cook until crisp and beginning to brown on the edges, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas on the stove or in the microwave. To assemble, fill them with chicken, Tahini Sauce, diced onion and cilantro.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the tahini, lemon juice and 3 tablespoons cold water until the mixture thickens. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
